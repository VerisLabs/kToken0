/// Key characteristics: (1) Authorized minters (kMinter for institutional deposits, kAssetRouter for yield

/// can create/destroy tokens, (2) kMinter mints tokens 1:1 when assets are deposited and burns during redemptions,
/// (3) kAssetRouter mints tokens to distribute positive yield to vaults and burns tokens for negative yield/losses,
/// (4) Implements three-tier role system: ADMIN_ROLE for management, EMERGENCY_ADMIN_ROLE for emergency operations,
/// MINTER_ROLE for token creation/destruction, (5) Features emergency pause mechanism to halt all transfers during
/// protocol emergencies, (6) Supports emergency asset recovery for accidentally sent tokens. The contract ensures
/// protocol integrity by maintaining that kToken0 supply accurately reflects the underlying asset backing plus any
/// distributed yield, while enabling efficient yield distribution without physical asset transfers.
